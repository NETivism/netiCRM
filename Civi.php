/**
 * Class Civi
 *
 * The "Civi" class provides a facade for accessing major subsystems,
 * such as the service-container and settings manager. It serves as a
 * bridge which allows procedural code to access important objects.
 *
 * General principles:
 *  - Each function provides access to a major subsystem.
 *  - Each function performs a simple lookup.
 *  - Each function returns an interface.
 *  - Whenever possible, interfaces should be well-known (e.g. based
 *    on a standard or well-regarded provider).
